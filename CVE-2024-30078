Challenge Name: WiFi RCE!

Hardware required to run the challenge: a windows laptop with wifi that is unpatched for CVE-2024-30078

Flags: I could see this going two ways, either you pop calc.exe or some other thing to demonstrate RCE for a village staffer, OR there could just be a text file on the Desktop that contains the flag


Software Setup: Install windows 11 with minimal updates, and then add all the MS update server to the hosts file with bad IPs

Flag Rolling procedure: Just change the flag that is saved in a text file on the desktop, or if we wanna just make it so that you pop calc.exe for a village staffer then there wouldnt really be one.

potential methodologies to capture the flags:
Fam I got no clue, if anyone has the PoC for this they havent shared it with me yet.
