Challenge Name: IoT Device RCE


Hardware required to run the challenge: Evowera Planck Mini: https://www.amazon.com/evowera-Toothbrush-Reminder-Compatible-Detachable/dp/B0B3XQN59S
I can provide two of these devices

Flags: Players are given a Flag to enter into the scoreboard after exploiting an insecure wireless firmware update process as demontrated by writing their player or team name to the device's screen


Software Setup: The evowera toothbrush runs the default factory firmware. 

Flag Rolling procedure: I can provide a bash script that can be run that will reflash the the copy of the factory firmware I will provide


potential methodologies to capture the flags:
Players will need to sniff wifi beacon requests for devices with espressif OUI's to determine the network the devices are attempting to connect to
After standing up a network for the device to connect to, player will need to intercept and respond to several http get requests
The player will need to create their own esp32 firmware that writes their team or player name to the devices screen
After several successfull API responses the user gets the oportunity to respond with a URL for a bin file for an OTA update
If the firmware update is successfull and the screen shows the player or team name, a village staff member will give the player the flag to enter into the scoreboard
