Challenge Name: ESPNow Sniffing

Hardware required to run the challenge: 2 ESP32 of any variety

Flags: there are two flags to this challenge. The first flag is contained/transmitted in an ESPNow broadcast packet.
The second flag is being sent point to point in a direct message between the two ESP32. 


Software Setup: I will provide a sketch that can be used to flash both ESP32

Flag Rolling procedure: Im open to any feedback ya'll have on what the easiest eay to roll flags for you are is. 
The two things i can think of are to connect the esp32 to a computer over their serial ports and enable flag setting through sending strings to the devices.
A more stand alone solution could be that when initially powered on the units wait until a client connects via regular wifi and accesses a web page to set the flag.


potential methodologies to capture the flags:
For the broadcast flag, an ESP32 could be programmed to print any data it sees in ESPNow broadcasts via serial to the players machine.
For the point to point flag, players are encouraged to figure out how create new or leverage existing tools to get a regular 802.11 wifi card to be able to monitor and
parse ESPNow data.
